Computer Science is the foundation of everything I do. From the first line of code I wrote at university to designing distributed systems at scale today, it's a discipline that keeps evolving — and so do I.

## What This Series Is About

In this series I'll be writing about the core concepts and practical lessons I've picked up over 10+ years of building software. Topics will include:

- **Algorithms & Data Structures** — the building blocks that never go out of style
- **System Design** — how to architect software that scales
- **Distributed Systems** — consistency, availability, and the trade-offs in between
- **Software Engineering Best Practices** — clean code, testing, CI/CD, and beyond

## Why I'm Writing This

I've mentored fresh graduates and interns throughout my career, and one thing I've noticed is that strong fundamentals make the biggest difference. This series is my attempt to share what I wish I'd known earlier — and to keep sharpening my own thinking by writing it down.

Whether you're a student, a junior engineer, or a seasoned developer looking for a fresh perspective, I hope you'll find something useful here.

Stay tuned for the first deep-dive post.
