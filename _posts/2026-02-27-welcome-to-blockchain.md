Blockchain caught my attention not as a buzzword, but as a genuinely interesting engineering problem: how do you build a system that multiple untrusted parties can agree on, without a central authority? That question led me deep into distributed consensus, cryptography, and eventually DeFi and smart contract development.

## What This Series Is About

I'll be exploring blockchain from an engineer's perspective:

- **How blockchains actually work** — consensus mechanisms, cryptographic primitives, and the data structures underneath
- **Smart Contract Development** — writing, testing, and auditing contracts for DeFi and tokenized assets
- **DeFi deep dives** — protocols, mechanisms, and the financial logic behind them
- **Real-world use cases** — where blockchain adds genuine value and where it doesn't

## Why Blockchain

I hold a Blockchain Specialization certificate and have worked on cryptography and smart contract development for DeFi and tokenized assets. But beyond the credentials, what keeps me interested is the intersection of computer science, cryptography, and economics — three fields I find endlessly fascinating.

This series is for developers who want to understand what's actually happening under the hood.
