Not everything worth writing about involves code. This section of the blog is where I step away from the technical deep-dives and write about life — living abroad, things I'm learning, and whatever's on my mind.

## What This Series Is About

A mix of things:

- **Life in Singapore** — observations from a Vietnamese engineer living and working in one of Asia's most dynamic cities
- **Learning & Growth** — books, ideas, and habits that have shaped how I think
- **Tennis & Sport** — I play tennis regularly and believe sport teaches lessons that translate directly to work and life
- **Reflections** — honest thoughts on career, ambition, balance, and what it all means

## Why Write About Personal Life

I've read a lot of technical blogs that are excellent but feel detached — as if the person behind the keyboard doesn't exist outside of their IDE. I want this blog to be different. The best engineers I've worked with are curious, well-rounded people who bring life experience to their work.

So alongside the technical posts, I'll occasionally share what I'm reading, thinking about, or doing — in the hope that it's useful or at least interesting to someone out there.

Welcome along.
