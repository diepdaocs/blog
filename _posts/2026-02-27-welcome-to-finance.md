Finance and technology have been intertwined throughout my career. Working on a financial market terminal at Standard Chartered Bank — computing PnL, Greeks, and real-time risk for trading desks — gave me a front-row seat to how technology powers modern financial markets.

## What This Series Is About

This series sits at the intersection of finance and engineering:

- **Financial Market Concepts** — how markets work, what traders actually look at, and the mechanics behind instruments like options and futures
- **Quantitative Finance** — pricing models, risk metrics (PnL, Greeks, VaR), and the mathematics underneath
- **FinTech Engineering** — building low-latency, high-reliability systems for financial applications
- **Personal Finance** — investing principles, mental models for thinking about money, and lessons learned

## Why Finance

Most software engineers don't need to understand finance deeply. But if you're building systems where money moves — whether that's a trading platform, a payments app, or a DeFi protocol — understanding the financial context makes you a dramatically better engineer.

That's the angle I'll be writing from: a software engineer who had to learn finance on the job, and found it far more interesting than expected.
